DESCRIPTION


FIREBASE HOISTING -> ionic-mindly.firebaseapp.com 
FIREBASE HOISTING -> ionic-mindly.web.app


* When you select the date or the time, it changes dynamically at the lower sections with the additional button.
 
* When you click on the Sign up for a free meeting button, the selected date and time will be saved in Firestore, so that when you reload the page, or if you go from the Incognito Window, the same time and day remain (until someone rewrites them again).

* We have 3 psychologists, and each of them has a different available schedule for consultation. When choosing another psychologist, the data in other two sliders changes.

* When the page was reloaded, the psychologist, the date and the time that were last recorded in the Firestore (when you click on the Sign up for a free meeting button) came out as default / starting (that is, 3 horizontal scrolling elements show the required psychologist, day and time).

* The mini project is written with TypeScript.
